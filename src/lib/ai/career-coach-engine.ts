Your overall SQL score is **51%**, but the AI Diagnostic Engine evaluated individual sub-topics rather than an unhelpful blanket percentage:

- ✅ **Basics & SELECT**: **86%** *(Mastered)*
- ✅ **WHERE Filtering & IN**: **78%** *(Proficient)*
- 🟡 **Aggregation (COUNT, AVG)**: **71%** *(Proficient)*
- 🟡 **GROUP BY vs HAVING**: **69%** *(Needs Attention)*
- 🔴 **Relational JOINs**: **42%** *(Critical Gap)*
- 🟡 **Correlated Subqueries**: **51%** *(Needs Attention)*
- 🔴 **Advanced SQL (Window Functions)**: **32%** *(Critical Gap)*

#### ⚠️ Recurring Mistake Pattern Identified:
*"Relational Set Coupling vs. Correlated Subquery Optimization"*
- **Specific Error:** In 3 consecutive questions, you used nested subqueries ($O(N^2)$ scan latency) where indexed \`INNER/LEFT JOIN\` ($O(N)$ execution plan) was required.
- **NULL Handling:** You also selected \`INNER JOIN\` when non-matching customer records needed to be preserved with \`LEFT JOIN\` + \`COALESCE()\`.

No problem! A consistent 20 minutes is far more effective than cramming for hours once a week.

#### 🎯 Micro-Session Target: **SQL LEFT JOIN NULL Preservation**
- **00:00 – 04:00 (4 mins) • Visual Rule:**
  - Remember: When a customer has no orders, \`LEFT JOIN\` produces \`NULL\` in the order columns. Use \`COALESCE(Orders.Amount, 0)\` to avoid arithmetic errors.
- **04:00 – 14:00 (10 mins) • 2 Hands-on Problems:**
  - Problem 1: Return all registered users who placed zero orders in the last 30 days.
  - Problem 2: Calculate total lifetime value including customers with $0 revenue.
- **14:00 – 20:00 (6 mins) • Quick 3-Question Probe:**

Bhai ekdum simple real-world example se samjho! 💡

Maan lo tum **Zomato** ka database bana rahe ho:
1. **\`Customers\` Table:**
   - \`id\`, \`name\`, \`city\` (Jaise: *Safal*, *Rahul*, *Priya*)
2. **\`Orders\` Table:**
   - \`order_id\`, \`customer_id\`, \`item_name\`, \`amount\`

Agar humein dekhna hai ki *"Kis customer ne kya khana order kiya?"*, toh hum common column (\`customer_id\`) ke basis par **JOIN** karte hain:

\`\`\`sql
SELECT 
    Customers.name, 
    Orders.item_name, 
    Orders.amount
FROM Customers
INNER JOIN Orders ON Customers.id = Orders.customer_id;
\`\`\`

#### 🔑 4 Simple Types (Jo exam aur interview mein puchte hain):
1. **INNER JOIN**: Sirf wahi log aayenge jinhone order kiya hai (Matching rows only).
2. **LEFT JOIN**: **Saare customers aayenge!** Agar kisi ne order nahi bhi kiya, toh uska naam aayega aur order columns mein \`NULL\` hoga.
3. **RIGHT JOIN**: Saare orders aayenge chahe customer record mile ya na mile.
4. **FULL OUTER JOIN**: Dono tables ka complete data aayega (Matching + Non-matching).

#### ⚠️ Tumhari Common Galti:
Diagnostic test mein tumne \`INNER JOIN\` use kar diya tha jab question bol raha tha *"Show ALL customers including those with no orders"*. Wahan **LEFT JOIN** lagta hai!

Here are **2 high-frequency questions** designed specifically around your identified mistake patterns:

---

#### ❓ Question 1 (JOIN Semantics & NULL Handling):
You have a \`Users\` table (200 rows) and an \`ActivityLog\` table (150 rows). You execute:
\`\`\`sql
SELECT u.name, COUNT(a.id) AS total_events
FROM Users u
LEFT JOIN ActivityLog a ON u.id = a.user_id
GROUP BY u.name;
\`\`\`
If 30 users have **zero** activity logs, how many rows will be returned?

- **A)** 170 rows
- **B)** 200 rows (Correct! All users preserved with \`total_events = 0\`)
- **C)** 150 rows
- **D)** Syntax Error due to GROUP BY

---

#### ❓ Question 2 (Subquery vs. JOIN Performance):
Why is \`WHERE user_id IN (SELECT user_id FROM Orders WHERE amount > 500)\` often slower than \`INNER JOIN (SELECT DISTINCT user_id FROM Orders WHERE amount > 500) o ON u.id = o.user_id\` in legacy relational engines?

- **A)** Subqueries force temporary table spills and prevent index join pushes.
- **B)** Subqueries cannot return integers.
- **C)** \`IN\` automatically causes deadlocks.

Your Skill DNA currently tags **Power BI at 34% (Self-Declared)**. If you jump directly into advanced DAX formulas without foundational data modeling, you will struggle with calculated columns vs measures.

Here is the exact **learning sequence** that builds genuine enterprise BI competence:

\`\`\`
1. SQL Relational Data Modeling (Current: 51% -> Target: 75%)
   └── Master Primary/Foreign Keys, One-to-Many Relationships, and JOINs.
          │
          ▼
2. Star Schema & Data Normalization (1NF -> 3NF)
   └── Learn Fact Tables vs. Dimension Tables (Date, Customer, Product).
          │
          ▼
3. Power BI Basics & Power Query (ETL)
   └── Clean, transform, and merge CSV/Database connections.
          │
          ▼
4. DAX Formulas (CALCULATE, FILTER, RELATED)
   └── Build dynamic measures and KPI cards.

Based on your live Skillora data, your overall Career Readiness score is **${context.overallCareerReadinessScore}% (Tier 2 Competitive)**. You are already in the top quartile of campus applicants, but here is exactly why you aren't at **Tier-1 Prime Status (88%+)** yet:

1. **Critical Skill Deficit in Enterprise Telemetry**:
   - Your **Power BI & Data Visualization** score is currently **48% (Critical Gap)**. Enterprise cloud teams require developers to build KPI observability dashboards.
2. **Missing Kubernetes Verification**:
   - While you have verified Docker skills (85%), your **Kubernetes & Helm orchestration** score is **65%**, leaving missing keywords on ATS scans.
3. **GD Rebuttal Speed**:
   - In your recent Group Discussion round, your composite score was **${context.groupDiscussion.latestScore}%**. You maintained great airtime (**${context.groupDiscussion.airtimePercentage}%**), but hesitated to challenge dominant counter-arguments.

**Projected Outcome:** Closing your Power BI lab and adding Kubernetes manifests will elevate your score to **89%**, making you immediately ready for Tier-1 corporate screening.`,

1. **Low-Level System Memory & Concurrency Question**:

   - *Diagnostic:* You accurately explained Redis mutex locks, but did not address probabilistic early expiration (XFetch algorithm) or stampede thundering herds.
2. **Response Latency & Hesitation**:
   - Your average response latency was **3.2 seconds** (very good), but on Question #3 it spiked to **6.8 seconds** with filler words.

Bhai simple shabdon mein samjho! 💡

**SQL JOIN** ka use hum tab karte hain jab humein 2 ya zyada alag-alag tables ke related data ko ek single result mein combine karna hota hai.

#### 🛒 Real-World Example (E-Commerce):
1. **Customers Table:**
   - \`CustomerID\`, \`Name\`, \`City\`
2. **Orders Table:**
   - \`OrderID\`, \`CustomerID\`, \`Amount\`

Agar humein dekhna hai ki *"Kis Customer ne kitne amount ka order place kiya?"*, toh hum common key (\`CustomerID\`) ke through **INNER JOIN** lagate hain:

\`\`\`sql
SELECT Customers.Name, Orders.OrderID, Orders.Amount
FROM Customers
INNER JOIN Orders ON Customers.CustomerID = Orders.CustomerID;
\`\`\`

#### ⚡ Quick Types of JOINs:
- **INNER JOIN:** Sirf wahi records aate hain jo dono tables mein match karte hain.
- **LEFT JOIN:** Left table ke saare records + Right table ke matching records.
- **RIGHT JOIN:** Right table ke saare records + Left table ke matching records.
- **FULL OUTER JOIN:** Dono tables ke saare records chahe match ho ya na ho.

A **SQL JOIN** is an operation used to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them.

#### 📊 Visual Analogy:
Consider two relational tables:
- **\`Customers\`** (\`id\`, \`name\`, \`email\`)
- **\`Orders\`** (\`id\`, \`customer_id\`, \`total_price\`)

By executing an **INNER JOIN** on \`Customers.id = Orders.customer_id\`, relational engines construct a unified tuple:

\`\`\`sql
SELECT 
    c.name, 
    o.id AS order_id, 
    o.total_price
FROM Customers c
INNER JOIN Orders o ON c.id = o.customer_id;
\`\`\`

#### 🔑 Four Core Join Types:
1. **INNER JOIN**: Returns records that have matching values in both tables.
2. **LEFT (OUTER) JOIN**: Returns all records from the left table, and matched records from the right table (NULL if no match).
3. **RIGHT (OUTER) JOIN**: Returns all records from the right table, and matched records from the left table.
4. **FULL (OUTER) JOIN**: Returns all records when there is a match in either left or right table.`,
